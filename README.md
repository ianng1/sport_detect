# sport_detection_project

This is a sample side machine learning project I created in my own spare time. It reached about 80% accuracy on testing samples- 
though much higher with tennis, at about 90%+, as compared to basketball and football, at about 70%.

Attached in the "validation" folder is a small subset of the images used for testing.
